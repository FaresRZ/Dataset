"Mobile manipulator is a mechanical system typically consisting of one articulated manipulator mounted on holonomic or non-holonomic mobile base. Such a system, which is usually characterized by a high degree of redundancy, combines the manipulability of a fixed-base manipulator with the mobility of a mobile base. Accordingly, a mobile manipulator is able to accomplish most common complicated tasks of robotics in large workspaces that require locomotion and manipulation capabilities and may include many obstacles. Many works have been carried out for motion planning of autonomous mobile manipulators. It consists of one of the important tasks in intelligent control of such autonomous robots. The objective of the proposed final year project is to generate a collision-free path (for the mobile base and for the manipulator) for a mobile manipulator in acomplex, known environment with obstacles. The collision-free path connects an initial situation (XE, YE, ZE)Init to a predefined final situation (XE, YE, ZE)Fin of the end-effector of the robot. The implementation and validation will be done on the RobuTER/ULM mobile manipulator of the CDTA research center in the workroom of the DPR division.",CEA1
"This work deals with the study of the compression system and the active control of surge phenomenon, considering the Moore-Greitzer model with recycling valve, including uncertainty parameters and external disturbance. Feedback linearization approach is used to linearize the original nonlinear model of the system. To stabilize the linearized model in the presence of external disturbance, the Adaptive control approach is proposed. Simulation of the obtained results is done with Simulink.",CEA2
"This project consists of designing a Programmable Logic Controller based multilevel car parking system using Siemens SIMATIC S7-300(CPU 315) PLC. This latter enables the system to operate in real time and to be responsible of the entire behavior of the system. The type of the parking garage is Multi floor parking type-circulation. The parking garage implemented contains two floors and this is due to the limitation of the used PLC; but using the same architecture and algorithm, it can be extended to any number of floors required. The parking system is designed to rotate the plate where the car is put to reach the desired angle of the slot, then it will move it vertically using an elevator to reach the desired level, to place the car in its appropriate slot, a horizontal tray is used. SIMATIC Step7 is used to develop the algorithm that is used by the PLC for the control process; and using SIMATIC Wincc, an HMI is developed that monitors the system operation.",CEA3
"Now-a-days, the industrial monitoring field requires more manual power to monitor and control the industrial parameters such as pressure, temperature, water level, etc...This is one of the most upcoming issues in the industrial sectors. If the parameters are not monitored and controlled properly, it leads to a harmful situation. The general objective of our project is the design of PID and self-tuning Fuzzy PID controller algorithm for controlling industrial parameters of a process. As an application, a process simulator associated with a heating and cooling devices are considered as a test-platform for implementing the self-tuning Fuzzy PID controller algorithm. LABVIEW simulator is used for simulating the PID and self-tuning Fuzzy PID controller algorithm. The implementation part combines many hardware devices and software components. The hardware part consists of a S7-300 PLC, S7-200 PLC, PC: considered as OPC server and also as a human machine interface (HMI) of the process, temperature process simulator. The software part consists of LABVIEW, SIMATIC step7, NI OPC and NetToPLCsim which are used in each service for the process control operation, display and communication functions. The whole system provides a good combination of various protocol implementations (TCP/IP and MPI protocols) in creating a bidirectional network and the use of an advanced graphical user interface (developed using LABVIEW) that monitor the control system. The simulation results show that self-tuning Fuzzy PID controller system achieves real-time precise control of temperature, improves the control performances and has a profound practical significance.",CEA4
"Controlling and directing a mobile robot to a specified destination with desired performance criteria is extremely important in the navigation process. This report deals with all necessary details and strategies performed to ensure the robot_s ability to move autonomously and freely. To evaluate this, visual perception using Kinect camera is performed to model the environment through image processing techniques; sensor fusion is used to estimate the robot position to minimize the noise and uncertainties using Kalman filter; genetic algorithm is implemented to generate an optimal path, after that an adaptive fuzzy logic controller is designed to keep track of the differential drive mobile robot on the desired trajectory by transmitting the appropriate right and left velocities using wireless communication through socket programming.",CEA5
"The work presented in this thesis tackles the problem of path planning for a mobile robot tethered to a base by a flexible cable assumed to be always stretched with finite length L. Our method proposes the generation of the shortest admissible path from the base as an initial solution, then refine it by means of a shortcut algorithm. Using the important notion of homotopic classes in the random shortcut algorithm helps finding a heuristic that determines whether a goal position can be reached for a given initial cable layout. The algorithm was tested and validated on OMPL platform by planning trajectories in an environment with polygonal obstacles, and by setting different cable lengths. Results of our path planning approach have shown that the obtained smoothed path between base and goal position matches exactly the cables configuration. Moreover, homotopy classes are preserved when performing the smoothing operation over the path. This chapter concludes the work presented throughout this dissertation. It first recapitulates our approach for solving the path planning problem of a tethered mobile robot then, it states the research contribution extracted from the proposals and simulation. Finally further discussions about future work and interesting research issues are treated.",CEA6
"Oil and gas companies are, largely, using of the centrifugal compressors. One of the major control problems is associated with this type of compressors, which is the pressure fluctuation or what is called surge. To reduce this pressure fluctuation and enhance the overall stability of the compression system, many methods and techniques are designed and applied in this field. One of these techniques is called active surge control. Active surge control aims at stabilizing the compressor at the unstable region which is located at the positive slope characteristic region. An actuator to be used is the recycle valve, and a method of design is the feedback linearization, the one which will be enhanced with a self-tuning regulator to overcome the parameter changes and disturbances. In this project we have showed that we can use the recycle valve as an active surge actuator and the results were successful. Also the application of the feedback linearization to the recycle compression system has showed promising results and quite accurate simple model to design the new system. The self-tuning regulator works well in the new linearized system which all gives an insight to the robustness of the controller.",CEA7
"A fundamental robotics task is to plan collision-free motions from a start to a goal position among a collection of static obstacles. The traditional motion planning methods suffers from the problem of local minima and the need of the re-planning each time the robot get away from its path. This project has the objective to design and implement an optimal feedback motion planning algorithm for the B21R mobile robot. The presented method computes a feedback plan in the presence of the obstacles. Instead of computing a trajectory between a pair of Initial and goal state, our algorithm computes a vector field over the entire space, which guaranteed that the goal is reached from any point in the plane, and also this method provides an optimal trajectory taking in consideration different cost functions. The simulation of this method has confirmed the fact that the goal is reached from any point in the plane, but with a suboptimal path.",CEA8

"Centrifugal compressors are the most adequate and the widely used in oil and gas companies, but this type of compressors are associated with a very dangerous incident called surge; this thesis presents a deep study on this phenomenon and proposes appropriate techniques in order to avoid its harmful impact on the compression system and to let the whole system operates in the stable region with a maximum efficiency. The first step in our work was stating a mathematical modeling for the compression system in Matlab Simulink, then for the regulation of the system both of PI fuzzy logic and PD fuzzy logic controllers are used for controlling and automating the recycle valve that was before controlled manually, moreover, some other elaborated controllers are proposed: the traditional PID controller that has some drawbacks compared to the multi stage fuzzy logic PID controller that optimizes the compression system.",CEA10
"This project presents a tuning approach based on a metaheuristic methods to obtain the optimal Proportional-Integral-Derivative (PID) controller parameters. This PID is used within a closed loop consisting of an amplifier, exciter, generator and the voltage sensor. The whole system including the PID is known as the Automatic Voltage Regulator (AVR). The objective of this optimization design is to achieve high performance voltage control of the generator. This objective must be well coded using a cost function to be optimized by the global search algorithm.

"The use of dedicated computer-based control systems to solve automation problems is essential to manufacturing automation today. This work describes the study and the design strategy of a control system for the operation of an automatic punching-press machine with a conveyor system. The punching-press is automatically set to punch holes in a metal tape then cut the tape into a desired number of small sheets with a predefined length. This operation is followed by a conveyor that takes the sheets to their destination. The overall control is based on a programmable logic unit, sensory elements and motion control technique which are used to achieve the system control requirements. Also, the system is associated with a human machine user interface (HMI). The functionality of this control system is analyzed and verified through qualitative and quantitative simulation models and adjusted according to the requirement of the system operator.",CEA13
"Diffusion Magnetic Resonance Imaging is a Magnetic Resonance Imaging technique that provides information about the structure of neuronal pathways found in the white matter. The aim of this project is to estimate the diffusion orientation of water molecules of white matter fiber bundles, in order to map complex neural architecture. High Angular Resolution Diffusion Imaging (HARDI) is a non-invasive in vivo method to characterize voxels containing multiple fiber crossings unlike Diffusion Tensor Imagine which fails to do so. In particular, Q-ball imaging (QBI) and constraint spherical deconvolution (CSD) are both HARDI methods that seek to obtain the true fiber orientation. The first technique is based on extracting the diffusion orientation distribution function (ODF). While CSD approach looks for the fiber orientation distribution function (fODF). The present project develops and implements an estimation of the HARDI methods and their visualization using real human brain data to show the ability of these methods to solve the problem of mapping crossing white matter fiber bundles.",CEA14
